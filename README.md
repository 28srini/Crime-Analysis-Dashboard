This Power BI project analyzes crime data from 2020 to 2024, offering actionable insights into crime trends, case metrics, and geospatial patterns. The dashboard includes interactive visualizations such as case metrics (reported, open, and closed), reporting delay analysis, crime domains with gender breakdown, victim age categories (pie chart), and police deployment levels (funnel chart). It also features area insights, detailed crime descriptions in table format, and a map to visualize crime hotspots and trends geographically. Built using Power BI, DAX, Power Query, and geospatial analysis, this project focuses on creating interactive, user-friendly dashboards for informed decision-making.
